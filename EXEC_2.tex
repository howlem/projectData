\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
This paper uses data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to examine the relationship between yield, production, and area harvested in Africa.

\section{Data}\label{datas}
The data is drawn from 2016 FAO data. Each variable (described in more detail below) is aggregated by country. So, for example, all the yield data for Togo in 2016 is aggregated into one amount for the whole country.
